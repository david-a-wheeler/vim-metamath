# vim-metamath

This is vim-metamath, a vim mode for editing [metamath](http://metamath.org/)
files by David A. Wheeler.

This is has the same goals, but is otherwise unrelated to the
[marnix/metamath.vim mode](https://github.com/marnix/metamath.vim).
This mode is much more ambitious and handles much more.
In particular, it highlights different kinds of comments.

# INSTALLATION

Just copy the files in vim/ to your local vim files directory.
On Unix/Linux systems that is "${HOME}/.vim", while on
Windows it is "%userprofile%\vimfiles".
If you're running Unix/Linux and have "make", running "make install"
will install the program.
